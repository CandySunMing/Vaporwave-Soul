	<h2>What is Vaporwave?</h2>
	<p class="introduction">Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s.[18] The style is defined by its appropriation of 1980s and 1990s mood music styles such as smooth jazz, elevator music, R&B, and lounge music, typically sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects.</p>

	<h2>Visual</h2>
	<p class="introduction">
		The cover art and videos for vaporware are just as important as the music. As previously stated, the vaporwave aesthetic is rooted in nostalgia, a combination of different and strange ephemera from the 1980s and 1990s. This imagery can include anime, cyberpunk, late 90s web design, the twin towers, early internet message boards, 3D-object renderings, Greek statues, cityscapes, men in suits, IKEA-bought interiors, airport bars, corporate logos, early computer games, especially NES and Nintendo, and shopping malls. It’s also not uncommon for album art to look like old cassette or CD covers. Perhaps a classic distillation of this aesthetic is the description for <em>World Class by Luxury Elite:</em>
		<br>
		<br>
		<blockquote>"Imagine for a moment if you will, a parallel universe in which Tom Cruise’s 1988 hit Cocktail was actually a gritty noir, full of smoke-filled scenes of low-lit bars and brutalist executive suites. World Class – the new full-length from Luxury Elite – is the essential soundtrack to such a film; a love letter to ‘80s America, smooth jazz, lounge music and skyscraper skylines by night."</blockquote>
